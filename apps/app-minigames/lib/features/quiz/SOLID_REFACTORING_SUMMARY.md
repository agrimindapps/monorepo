# Quiz - SOLID Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Quiz feature is a trivia game where players answer questions within a time limit. Players have 3 lives and earn points based on how quickly they answer correctly. The refactoring extracted business logic from Use Cases into specialized services following SOLID principles.

## Violations Identified

### 1. Score Calculation in Use Case
**File**: `select_answer_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Inline scoring logic
final updatedScore = currentGameState.score + currentGameState.timeLeft;
```
**Issues**:
- Business logic in Use Case
- No speed bonus system
- No answer quality classification

### 2. Lives Deduction Duplicated
**Files**: `select_answer_usecase.dart` and `handle_timeout_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Duplicated logic in 2 places
final updatedLives = currentGameState.lives - 1;
```
**Issues**:
- Code duplication
- Magic numbers (hardcoded -1)
- No danger zone detection

### 3. Game Over Checks Duplicated
**Files**: `select_answer_usecase.dart` and `handle_timeout_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Duplicated game over checks
if (updatedLives <= 0) {
  // Game over logic
}
```
**Issues**:
- Duplicated validation logic
- Magic numbers (hardcoded <= 0)
- No game over reason classification

### 4. Timer Reset in Use Case
**File**: `next_question_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Inline timer logic
timeLeft: currentGameState.difficulty.timeInSeconds,
```
**Issues**:
- Timer management in Use Case
- No time pressure tracking
- No timer status classification

### 5. No Question Shuffling
**File**: `generate_game_questions_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Returns all questions without shuffling
return Right(questions);
```
**Issues**:
- No randomization
- No question selection logic
- No validation

  allQuestions: allQuestions,
  count: 10,
);

// Track progress
final progress = questionManagerService.getProgress(
  currentIndex: 5,
  totalQuestions: 10,
);
print('Progress: ${progress.progressPercentage}%'); // e.g., '60%'

// Manage timer
final timerStatus = questionManagerService.getTimerStatus(

```

## Enhanced Game Features

### Speed Bonus System
Players are rewarded for quick thinking:
- **Lightning Fast** (< 10% time used): +10 points
- **Fast** (< 25% time used): +5 points
- **Moderate** (< 50% time used): +2 points
- **Slow** (≥ 50% time used): No bonus

### Answer Quality Classification
Answers are classified into 6 quality levels:
1. **Perfect**: Correct + Lightning Fast
2. **Excellent**: Correct + Fast
3. **Good**: Correct + Moderate Speed
4. **Acceptable**: Correct + Slow
5. **Poor**: Correct + Very Slow
6. **Incorrect**: Wrong Answer

### Life Management System
- **Initial Lives**: 3
- **Lives Lost**: 1 per error or timeout
- **Danger Zone**: Warning when 1 life remaining
- **Warning Levels**: Low → Medium → High → Critical

### Timer Pressure Tracking
Timer status changes based on remaining time:
- **Good**: > 50% remaining (green)
- **Medium**: 25-50% remaining (yellow)
- **Low**: 10-25% remaining (orange)
- **Critical**: < 10% remaining (red)
- **Expired**: Time's up!
