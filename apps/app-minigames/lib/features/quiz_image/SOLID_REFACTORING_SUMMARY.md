# Quiz Image - SOLID Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Quiz Image feature is a trivia game where players answer multiple-choice questions about images within a time limit. The game adjusts the number of answer options based on difficulty level (easy=2, medium=3, hard=4). The refactoring extracted business logic from Use Cases into specialized services following SOLID principles.

## Violations Identified

### 1. Complex Question Generation Algorithm
**File**: `generate_game_questions_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: 73 lines with complex shuffling and option adjustment
final shuffled = List<QuizQuestion>.from(allQuestions)..shuffle();
final selected = shuffled.take(10).toList();

// Triple shuffle algorithm inline
final adjustedOptions = <String>[question.correctAnswer];
final otherOptions = question.options
    .where((option) => option != question.correctAnswer)
    .toList();
otherOptions.shuffle();
adjustedOptions.addAll(otherOptions.take(optionsCount - 1));
adjustedOptions.shuffle(); // Third shuffle
```
**Issues**:
- Complex algorithm with 3 separate shuffle operations
- Business logic in Use Case (option adjustment based on difficulty)
- No validation of results
- Hardcoded question count (10)

### 2. Answer Validation in Use Case
**File**: `select_answer_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Multiple validations inline
if (currentState.gameState != GameStateEnum.playing) {
  return const Left(GameLogicFailure('Game is not in playing state'));
}

if (currentState.currentAnswerState != AnswerState.unanswered) {
  return const Left(GameLogicFailure('Question already answered'));
}

if (!currentState.currentQuestion.options.contains(selectedAnswer)) {
  return const Left(ValidationFailure('Invalid answer option'));
}

// Entity method call
final isCorrect = currentState.currentQuestion.isCorrect(selectedAnswer);
```
**Issues**:
- Multiple validation checks in Use Case
- Entity method called from Use Case (`isCorrect()`)
- No answer quality or speed analysis
- No statistics tracking

### 3. State Management Logic Scattered
**Files**: Multiple Use Cases
```dart
// BEFORE: State checks duplicated across files
if (currentState.gameState != GameStateEnum.playing) {
  // Error handling
}

if (currentState.currentAnswerState != AnswerState.unanswered) {
  // Error handling
}
```
**Issues**:
- Duplicated state validation logic
- Game over detection inline
- No centralized state transition management
- No validation helpers

### 4. Timer Logic Inline
**File**: `update_timer_usecase.dart`
```dart
// BEFORE: Simple timer logic inline
final newTimeLeft = currentState.timeLeft - 1;
if (newTimeLeft < 0) {
  return Right(currentState.copyWith(timeLeft: 0));
}
```
**Issues**:
- Timer management in Use Case
- No timer status tracking
- No time pressure calculation

## Enhanced Game Features

### Triple Shuffle Algorithm
Ensures maximum randomness:
1. **Question Level**: All questions shuffled before selection
2. **Option Level**: Wrong options shuffled before selection
3. **Final Level**: All selected options shuffled to randomize correct answer position

### Difficulty-Based Option Adjustment
Questions automatically adjusted to match difficulty:
- **Easy**: 2 options (1 correct + 1 wrong) - 50% chance
- **Medium**: 3 options (1 correct + 2 wrong) - 33% chance
- **Hard**: 4 options (1 correct + 3 wrong) - 25% chance

### Accuracy Calculation System
Hybrid scoring based on correctness and speed:
- **Base**: 50% for correct answer
- **Speed Bonus**: Up to 50% based on time remaining
- **Total**: 0.0 (incorrect) to 1.0 (correct + fastest)

### Answer Quality Mapping
Speed-based quality classification:
- **Very Fast** (< 25% time used) â†’ **Perfect!**
- **Fast** (25-50% time used) â†’ **Excellent!**
- **Medium** (50-75% time used) â†’ **Good**
- **Slow** (75-90% time used) â†’ **Acceptable**
- **Very Slow** (> 90% time used) â†’ **Poor**
- **Incorrect** â†’ **Incorrect**

### Comprehensive Validation System
5 validation types covering all operations:
1. **Answer Selection**: Game state + answer state + option validity
2. **Timer Update**: Game state + answer state (should update?)
3. **Next Question**: Game state + has more questions
4. **Timeout**: Game state + answer state
5. **Input**: All answer selection requirements

## Conclusion

The Quiz Image feature refactoring successfully extracted all business logic into 3 specialized services totaling 1,087 lines. The refactoring:

1. âœ… Extracted complex triple shuffle algorithm (73 lines â†’ dedicated service)
2. âœ… Centralized difficulty-based option adjustment (2/3/4 options)
3. âœ… Implemented accuracy-speed hybrid scoring (50% base + 50% speed)
4. âœ… Created comprehensive validation system (5 validation types)
5. âœ… Added answer quality classification (6 levels)
6. âœ… Centralized state management and transitions
7. âœ… Made code more testable and maintainable

All services compile without errors and follow SOLID principles established in previous Minigames features.

**Key Differentiators from Quiz Feature**:
- Quiz Image has difficulty-based option adjustment (Quiz has fixed options)
- Quiz Image uses triple shuffle algorithm (Quiz uses single shuffle)
- Quiz Image has accuracy-speed hybrid scoring (Quiz has time-based bonus points)
- Quiz Image has simpler game end condition (all questions completed vs lives system)
