## üöÄ Quick Start

### Week 1: Immediate Actions (P0)

1. **Delete 6 unused services** (30 minutes)
   ```bash
   # See SERVICES_AUDIT_ACTION_PLAN.md Section 1.1
   # Gasometer: 3 files
   # Plantis: 3 files
   ```

2. **Review with team** (1 hour)
   - Present Executive Summary
   - Get approval for cleanup
   - Discuss migration priorities

3. **Create tracking issues** (2 hours)
   - Use templates from Action Plan
   - Assign responsibilities
   - Set deadlines

**Total Week 1 Effort**: ~4 hours
**Impact**: Very High (immediate technical debt reduction)

## üìã Critical Findings

### üî¥ Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

1. **6 unused services** - Dead code cluttering codebase
   - Impact: Maintenance overhead
   - Fix: Delete (30 min)

2. **Plantis: 4 notification service versions** - Major confusion
   - Impact: Development velocity, bugs
   - Fix: Consolidate to 1 (8 hours)

3. **Plantis: Secure storage duplication** - Not using enhanced core version
   - Impact: Missing features, inconsistency
   - Fix: Migrate to core (6 hours)

4. **Gasometer: 3 data cleaner versions** - Unclear which to use
   - Impact: Confusion, potential bugs
   - Fix: Consolidate to 1 (2 hours)

### üü° Opportunities for Improvement

5. **Plantis backup subsystem** - 7 services that could benefit all apps
   - Opportunity: Extract to core, enable cross-app backup
   - Effort: 16 hours

6. **11 generic services** - Should be in core for reuse
   - Opportunity: Increase code reuse, reduce duplication
   - Effort: 30 hours

## üéì Lessons Learned

### What Petiveti Did Right ‚≠ê
- Minimal app-level services (only 2)
- Maximum reuse of core package
- Clean separation of concerns
- **This is the target state**

### What to Avoid ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Creating app-level services for generic functionality
- Letting multiple versions accumulate (4 notification services!)
- Duplicating core functionality (secure_storage)
- Keeping unused code around

### Best Practices Moving Forward ‚úÖ
1. **Check core package first** before creating app service
2. **Delete immediately** when service becomes unused
3. **Consolidate on refactor** - don't create duplicate versions
4. **Follow Petiveti model** - lean app services, rich core package

## üîÑ Keeping This Audit Current

### When to re-audit:
- Every 3-6 months
- After major refactoring
- When adding new apps to monorepo
- If technical debt accumulates

### What to track:
- Number of app-level services (should decrease over time)
- Core package usage (should increase)
- Health scores (should improve)
- Unused services (should stay at 0)
