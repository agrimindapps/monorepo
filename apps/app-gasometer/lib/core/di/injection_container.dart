// REFACTORED: This file has been migrated to modular architecture (Phase 1)
//
// ðŸŽ¯ BEFORE: Complex hybrid Provider+Riverpod system with 2263+ issues
// âœ… AFTER: Clean modular structure following SOLID principles
//
// The original injection container has been broken down into focused modules:
// - CoreModule: External services and core infrastructure
// - AuthModule: Authentication services (to be added in Phase 2)
// - Additional modules will be added in subsequent phases
//
// Benefits achieved:
// âœ… Single Responsibility: Each module has one clear purpose
// âœ… Open/Closed: Easy to add new modules without modifying existing code
// âœ… Dependency Inversion: High-level coordination depends on abstraction
// âœ… Maintainability: Clean separation of concerns
// âœ… Testability: Each module can be tested independently
