Resolving dependencies...
Because receituagro depends on core from path which depends on riverpod_annotation ^3.0.3, riverpod_annotation ^3.0.3 is required.
So, because receituagro depends on riverpod_annotation ^2.3.5, version solving failed.


You can try the following suggestion to make the pubspec resolve:
* Try an upgrade of your constraints: flutter pub upgrade --major-versions
Failed to update packages.
