# Tower Feature - SOLID Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Tower feature is a physics-based stacking game where players drop horizontally-moving blocks to build a tower. Success depends on precision alignment, with progressively increasing difficulty through faster block movement. This refactoring extracted complex business logic from Use Cases into four specialized services following SOLID principles.

## Game Mechanics
- **Horizontal Movement**: Blocks move left-right across the screen at increasing speeds
- **Precision-Based Scoring**: Score calculated from overlap percentage and combo multiplier
- **Perfect Placement System**: ≥90% precision triggers combo increments and bonus points
- **Combo System**: Perfect placements build combo (reset on imperfect drops)
- **Progressive Difficulty**: Speed increases by 0.2 × difficulty multiplier per drop
- **Game Over**: Triggered when blocks don't overlap (overlap ≤ 0)

## Services Created

### 1. OverlapCalculationService (168 lines)
**Responsibility**: Calculate block overlap, precision, and placement quality

**Key Methods**:
- `calculateOverlap()` - Calculates overlap distance and precision ratio
  - Formula: `overlap = currentBlockWidth - abs(currentBlockPosX - lastBlockX)`
  - Precision: `overlap / currentBlockWidth` (0.0 to 1.0)
  - Perfect threshold: 90% precision
  - Game over detection: overlap ≤ 0

- `calculateAlignedPosition()` - Determines aligned X position after placement
  - Handles left/right alignment based on block positions
  - Ensures blocks sit correctly on top of each other

- `calculateNewBlockWidth()` - Calculates block width for next round
  - Next block width equals overlap (progressive difficulty)
  - Enforces minimum width to prevent impossibly small blocks

- `getPrecisionGrade()` - Returns quality tier (Perfeito/Excelente/Bom/Regular/Fraco)
- `isPerfectPlacement()` - Checks if precision meets perfect threshold
- `getPrecisionPercentage()` - Converts precision to percentage (0-100)

**Extracted From**: `DropBlockUseCase` (inline overlap and precision calculations)

**Benefits**:
- Isolated overlap algorithm with clear formula documentation
- Testable precision calculation
- Centralized perfect placement logic
- Reusable alignment calculations
- Quality grading for UI feedback

---

### 2. ScoringService (220 lines)
**Responsibility**: Calculate scores, manage combo system, and track achievements

**Key Methods**:
- `calculateScore()` - Computes drop score with combo multiplier
  - Base score: `(precision × 10).round()`
  - Final score: `baseScore × combo`
  - Combo management: increment on perfect (cap at 100), reset on imperfect
  - Returns complete ScoreResult with dropScore, combo, totalScore

- `calculateCombo()` - Updates combo multiplier based on performance
  - Perfect placement: increment by 1 (max 100)
  - Imperfect placement: reset to 1
  - Separate from scoring for external use

- `calculateDropScore()` - Previews score without updating state
  - Useful for showing potential score before drop

- `getScoreTier()` - Returns achievement tier based on total score
  - Tiers: Lendário (≥1000), Mestre (≥500), Avançado (≥250), Intermediário (≥100), Iniciante (<100)

  - Streak: combo ≥ 5
  - Bonus: combo × 5 points

- `calculateScoreEfficiency()` - Percentage of maximum possible score
  - Compares actual score against theoretical perfect play
  - Formula: `actualScore / (baseScore × blocksPlaced × (blocksPlaced + 1) / 2)`

**Extracted From**: `DropBlockUseCase` (inline score calculation, combo logic)

**Benefits**:
- Isolated scoring formula with clear documentation
- Testable combo system
- Achievement tier system for progression
- Score efficiency tracking for analytics
- Streak bonus system for engagement
- Preview calculations for UI

### 3. PhysicsService (262 lines)
**Responsibility**: Handle block movement, boundary detection, and speed calculations

**Key Methods**:
- `updatePosition()` - Updates block position with boundary detection
  - Movement: `posX + blockSpeed` (right) or `posX - blockSpeed` (left)
  - Right boundary: `posX + blockWidth >= screenWidth` → reverse to left
  - Left boundary: `posX <= 0` → reverse to right
  - Returns PhysicsUpdateResult with newPosX, direction, and reversal flag

- `calculateSpeedIncrease()` - Progressively increases speed after drops
  - Increment: `0.2 × difficulty.speedMultiplier`
  - Clamped: minSpeed (1.0) to maxSpeed (30.0)
  - Returns SpeedCalculationResult with tier info

- `calculateDifficultySpeedAdjustment()` - Recalculates speed when difficulty changes
  - Preserves speed progression ratio
  - Formula: `baseSpeed × newMultiplier × currentSpeedRatio`
  - Maintains game balance across difficulty switches

- `getSpeedTier()` - Returns speed description for UI
  - Tiers: Insano (≥20), Muito Rápido (≥15), Rápido (≥10), Moderado (≥5), Lento (<5)

- `calculateCrossingTime()` - Time for block to cross screen
  - Formula: `(screenWidth - blockWidth) / speed`
  - Useful for timing and difficulty balancing

- `isWithinBoundaries()` - Validates position within screen bounds
- `isTouchingRightBoundary()` / `isTouchingLeftBoundary()` - Boundary detection helpers
- `clampPosition()` - Constrains position to valid range

**Extracted From**:

## Formulas Reference

### Overlap Calculation
```dart
overlap = currentBlockWidth - abs(currentBlockPosX - lastBlockX)
precision = overlap / currentBlockWidth  // 0.0 to 1.0
isPerfect = precision >= 0.9  // 90% threshold
```

### Score Calculation
```dart
baseScore = (precision × 10).round()  // 0 to 10
finalScore = baseScore × combo
combo = isPerfect ? combo + 1 : 1  // Reset on imperfect, increment on perfect (max 100)
```

### Physics
```dart
// Movement
newPosX = movingRight ? posX + speed : posX - speed

// Boundary Detection
rightBoundary = posX + blockWidth >= screenWidth
leftBoundary = posX <= 0

// Speed Progression
speedIncrement = 0.2 × difficulty.speedMultiplier
newSpeed = currentSpeed + speedIncrement  // Clamped to 1.0-30.0
```

### Difficulty Speed Adjustment
```dart
currentSpeedRatio = currentSpeed / (baseSpeed × currentDifficulty.speedMultiplier)
newSpeed = baseSpeed × newDifficulty.speedMultiplier × currentSpeedRatio
```

## Testing Improvements

### Service Testing (Unit Tests)
```dart
// OverlapCalculationService
test('calculateOverlap with perfect center placement', () {
  final result = service.calculateOverlap(
    currentBlockWidth: 100,
    currentBlockPosX: 50,
    lastBlockX: 50,
  );
  expect(result.precision, 1.0);
  expect(result.isPerfect, true);
});

// ScoringService
test('calculateScore with perfect placement increases combo', () {
  final result = service.calculateScore(
    precision: 0.95,
    isPerfect: true,
    currentCombo: 5,
    currentTotalScore: 100,
  );
  expect(result.combo, 6);
  expect(result.dropScore, 9 * 6); // (0.95 * 10).round() * 6
});

// PhysicsService
test('updatePosition reverses at right boundary', () {
  final result = service.updatePosition(
    currentPosX: 190,
    blockWidth: 50,
    blockSpeed: 5,
    movingRight: true,
    screenWidth: 200,
  );
  expect(result.newMovingRight, false);
  expect(result.didReverse, true);
});

// BlockGenerationService
test('color cycling works correctly', () {
  final blocks = [/* 9 blocks */];
  final colorIndex = service.getNextColorIndex(blocks);
  expect(colorIndex, 9); // 10th block gets 10th color
});
```

### Use Case Testing (Integration Tests)
```dart
test('DropBlockUseCase with mocked services', () {
  final mockOverlapService = MockOverlapCalculationService();
  final mockScoringService = MockScoringService();
  final mockPhysicsService = MockPhysicsService();
  final mockBlockService = MockBlockGenerationService();
  
  final useCase = DropBlockUseCase(
    mockOverlapService,
    mockScoringService,
    mockPhysicsService,
    mockBlockService,
  );
  
  // Test orchestration without testing algorithm details
  // Services are mocked with expected behavior
});
```
